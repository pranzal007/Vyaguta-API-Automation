# API-Automation with Python

**Features:**

Modular Structure: The framework is organized into separate modules for configuration (config.py), generic API request functions (utilities.py), authentication (login.py), and test cases (tests/).

Configurability: API base URL and credentials are stored in config.py, making it easy to manage and update.

Authentication Handling: The login.py module contains functions to fetch access tokens, allowing seamless authentication for API requests.

Test Organization: Test cases are organized into separate files within the tests/ directory, allowing for easy management and navigation.
